📄 Project Review: Issues & Improvements
Target: Top 1% Ranking (EY Technathon)
1️⃣ Current Issues in the Project (Honest & Technical)
1.1 Conversation–Logic Leakage

Issue

System messages like:

I performed some checks and returned results: {...}

Raw JSON tool outputs
are leaking into the user conversation.

Why this is a problem

Breaks realism (feels like a prototype, not a product)

Exposes internal architecture to customers

Reduces evaluator confidence in production readiness

1.2 Overdependence on LLM for Control Flow

Issue

LLM is sometimes deciding when to move stages instead of backend enforcing it

Rate-limit errors (429) cause full chat failure

Why this is a problem

Credit flows must be deterministic

LLM failures should never break loan journeys

1.3 Sanction Letter Delivery UX Gaps

Issue

Download link sometimes shown as raw system path

Button visibility depends on fragile text parsing

Password sometimes explicitly revealed instead of explained

Why this is a problem

Financial documents need polished UX

Weakens trust and professionalism

1.4 Frontend–Backend Contract Mismatch

Issue

Frontend expects fields like letter_url, but backend sometimes embeds links inside text

No explicit action_type or ui_hint in API response

Why this is a problem

UI logic becomes brittle

Hard to scale or extend (mobile app, WhatsApp bot, etc.)

1.5 Agentic Architecture Not Fully Enforced

Issue

Master Agent sometimes exposes Worker Agent outcomes directly

Worker logic and AI logic partially mixed

Why this is a problem

Violates the core Agentic AI principle

Makes explanation to judges harder

1.6 Lack of Clear Failure & Recovery Paths

Issue

Rate limit or OpenAI failure → 500 error

User sees “Something went wrong”

Why this is a problem

In real NBFC systems, failures must degrade gracefully

Evaluators care deeply about resilience

2️⃣ Improvements Needed to Reach Top 1%
2.1 Enforce a Strict Conversation Contract

Fix
Backend must return structured responses only:

{
  "reply": "Human-readable message only",
  "stage": "ELIGIBILITY_CHECK",
  "ui_action": "SHOW_DOWNLOAD_BUTTON",
  "data": {
    "letter_url": "/generated_letters/sanction_rohan.pdf"
  }
}


Impact

Zero leakage

UI always knows what to render

Clean separation of concerns

2.2 Make Backend the Single Source of Truth

Fix

Backend controls stage transitions

LLM only generates natural language

Workers always run deterministically

Impact

Compliance-ready architecture

Judges will trust the system

2.3 Introduce Explicit UI Signals

Fix
Instead of parsing text, use:

"ui_action": "SHOW_SANCTION_DOWNLOAD"


Frontend reacts purely to flags, not text.

Impact

Button always appears correctly

No hacks

Looks production-grade

2.4 Add Graceful LLM Failure Handling

Fix
If OpenAI fails:

Return rule-based response

Continue flow if possible

Never expose errors to user

Impact

Turns rate-limit weakness into a strength

Judges will see engineering maturity

2.5 Strengthen Agentic Separation (Key EY Point)

Fix

Master Agent: conversation + orchestration

Worker Agents: pure functions, no language

Only Master Agent talks to user

Impact

Perfect alignment with Agentic AI definition

Easy to explain in demo

2.6 Upgrade Sanction Letter Experience

Fix

Always show:

Green “Download Sanction Letter” button

Password format explanation (not the password)

Never show file paths in chat

Impact

Looks like a real NBFC product

Strong trust signal
