ARMEK Financial Services – Agentic AI Personal Loan Assistant
Overview

ARMEK Financial Services is a web-based, Agentic AI-powered personal loan sales chatbot designed for NBFC-style lending journeys.
The system replaces static forms and heavy human-agent dependency with a human-like, conversational digital sales assistant that guides users end-to-end — from initial engagement to automated sanction letter generation.

The solution is built around a Master–Worker Agent architecture, where a central Master Agent orchestrates multiple specialized Worker agents responsible for verification, credit evaluation, approval decisioning, and documentation.

This project demonstrates how Agentic AI can increase conversion rates, improve customer experience, and automate loan origination workflows in a compliant and explainable manner.

Problem Statement

A large NBFC operating across India wants to increase revenue from its existing and new customer base by selling more personal loans through a web-based chatbot instead of relying only on human agents or static application forms.

Key challenges:

Low conversion rates from static forms

High operational cost of human agents

Delayed identification of eligible customers

Poor customer experience during loan discovery

The NBFC needs an AI-driven, conversational sales assistant that:

Feels human-like and personalized

Collects customer information step-by-step

Performs verification and eligibility checks

Automates approval and sanction letter generation

Maintains a smooth, compliant customer journey

Proposed Solution

ARMEK delivers a full Agentic AI loan assistant where:

A Master Agent is the only entity visible to the customer.

The Master Agent conducts a natural, guided conversation.

Behind the scenes, the Master Agent coordinates multiple Worker AI agents:

KYC / Verification Agent

Credit & Eligibility Agent

Sanction Letter Generation Agent

Each Worker performs a single, well-defined responsibility.

The Master Agent translates internal decisions into simple, customer-friendly responses.

The system supports real-time conversation, context retention, eligibility evaluation, approval decisions, and automated document generation.

Demo Flow (End-to-End)

User opens chatbot

Master Agent greets and asks for name

PAN verification via KYC Worker

Income and obligation capture

Credit evaluation via Credit Worker

Approval or rejection decision

Sanction letter generated by Document Worker

User downloads password-protected PDF

The full journey is completed within a single conversational interface.

Why This Stands Out

True Agentic architecture (not a single monolithic bot)

Clear Master–Worker orchestration

End-to-end automation (not just eligibility)

Professional UI and document output

Explainable and demo-safe decisioning

Designed like a real NBFC product, not a toy project

Disclaimer

This project is a demo / prototype built for evaluation and hackathon purposes.
Credit logic, KYC checks, and approval rules are simulated and do not represent real NBFC policies.
